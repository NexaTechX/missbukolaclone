# Web Search Intelligence Feature

Miss Bukola Lukan AI now has advanced web search capabilities to find current information about Gtext Holdings online when the knowledge base doesn't have sufficient information.

## 🌟 Key Benefits

### **Always Current Information**
- Finds latest news, announcements, and developments about Gtext Holdings
- Discovers current property prices, investment rates, and market information
- Locates recent interviews, media coverage, and public statements by leadership

### **Miss Bukola's Authentic Response**
- Processes web search results through Miss Bukola's leadership filter
- Maintains her decisive, confident tone while referencing online sources

### **Smart Decision Making**

- Searches specifically for Gtext Holdings, Stephen Akintayo, and Miss Bukola content
- Provides source attribution to distinguish between internal and external information

## 🔧 How It Works

### Automatic Activation
The AI automatically performs web search when:

1. **Low Knowledge Confidence** (< 60% from internal documents)
2. **Current Information Requests** (keywords: recent, latest, new, current, today, update)
3. **Specific External Queries** (prices, contact info, locations, recent news)

### Search Process
```
User Query → RAG Search → Confidence Check → Web Search (if needed) → Miss Bukola Response
```

1. **RAG First**: Always checks internal Gtext Holdings documents first
2. **Smart Detection**: Determines if web search would add value
3. **Targeted Search**: Searches specifically for Gtext Holdings information
4. **Result Processing**: Filters and summarizes web results
5. **Authentic Response**: Miss Bukola processes all information with her leadership style

### Example Interactions

#### **Query:** "What are the latest Gvest investment rates?"
**Response Process:**
- ✅ Internal docs show basic Gvest info
- 🔍 Web search finds current rate announcements
- 📝 Miss Bukola combines both sources: "Based on our current Gvest platform and recent market information, we're offering 14-26% returns annually..."

#### **Query:** "Tell me about Stephen Akintayo's recent Forbes recognition"
**Response Process:**
- ❌ No internal docs about specific Forbes mention
- 🔍 Web search finds Forbes article
- 📝 Miss Bukola responds with authority: "I'm pleased to share that our Chairman's recognition by Forbes as Africa's Best Investment Coach reflects our commitment to excellence..."

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

- **API Integration**: Uses Bing Search API for reliable results
- **Fallback System**: Works without API using pre-configured responses
- **Result Processing**: Extracts key information and calculates relevance
- **Context Filtering**: Focuses searches on Gtext Holdings ecosystem

### AI Integration (`BukolaAIService`)

## 📋 Configuration

### Required Environment Variable
```env
# Optional - Enables enhanced web search
BING_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_bing_search_api_key

2. Create new resource → Search for "Bing Search v7"
