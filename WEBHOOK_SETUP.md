# ðŸ”— Make.com Webhook Setup Guide

## âœ… Webhook Status

**URL:** [https://hook.eu2.make.com/mcq5vr986m7uh1tv8dovl89pbsrxx3n9](https://hook.eu2.make.com/mcq5vr986m7uh1tv8dovl89pbsrxx3n9)  
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ **Active** (Responding with "Accepted")  
**Purpose:** Receives structured task data when Request Mode is enabled

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### **1. Request Mode Activation**
When users enable "Request Mode" in the chat interface:
- Every message is interpreted as a task or command
- Miss Bukola AI processes the message into structured JSON
- The JSON task is automatically sent to your Make.com webhook

### **2. JSON Task Format**
The webhook receives data in this format:
```json
{
  "action": "assign",
  "task": "handle the onboarding session",
  "assignee": "Mr. John", 
  "due": "next Tuesday",
  "agent": "Bukola Lukan AI",
  "requested_by": "staff_user",
  "source": "request_mode",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "user_info": {
    "name": "John Smith",
    "department": "Operations", 
    "role": "Manager"
  }
}
```

### **3. Example User Interactions**

| User Message | Generated Task JSON |
|-------------|-------------------|
| "Please assign Sarah to review the quarterly reports by Friday" | `{"action": "assign", "task": "review the quarterly reports", "assignee": "Sarah", "due": "Friday"}` |
| "Schedule a team meeting for next Monday at 2 PM" | `{"action": "schedule", "task": "team meeting", "due": "next Monday at 2 PM"}` |
| "Follow up with the client about the Dubai property proposal" | `{"action": "follow_up", "task": "client contact about Dubai property proposal"}` |
| "Create a report on this month's sales performance" | `{"action": "create", "task": "monthly sales performance report"}` |

## ðŸ”§ Make.com Scenario Configuration

### **Step 1: Webhook Trigger**
- **Module:** Webhooks > Custom Webhook
- **URL:** Already configured as provided
- **Method:** POST
- **Headers:** Accepts JSON content

### **Step 2: Data Processing**
Process the incoming JSON to extract:
- `action` - What type of task (assign, create, schedule, etc.)
- `task` - Description of what needs to be done
- `assignee` - Who should handle it (if specified)
- `due` - When it should be completed
- `requested_by` - Who made the request
- `user_info` - Details about the requesting user

### **Step 3: Integration Options**
Connect to your preferred tools:

**Project Management:**
- Asana - Create tasks with assignees and due dates
- Trello - Add cards to specific boards
- Monday.com - Create items with status tracking
- Notion - Add database entries

**Communication:**
- Slack - Send notifications to relevant channels
- Microsoft Teams - Post messages and create tasks
- Email - Send task assignments via Gmail/Outlook

**Documentation:**
- Google Sheets - Log all requests for tracking
- Airtable - Maintain task database
- Notion - Create detailed task pages

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Testing

### **Test the Webhook**
1. **Via Browser:** Visit the webhook URL directly
   - Should return: "Accepted"
   - Confirms the endpoint is active

2. **Via API Route:** Use the built-in test endpoint
   ```bash
   GET /api/webhook/test
   ```

3. **Via Request Mode:** Enable Request Mode in the chat
   - Send a task message like "Assign John to handle client calls"
   - Check Make.com scenario logs for received data

### **Webhook Analytics**
Monitor in Make.com dashboard:
- **Operations count** - Number of tasks processed
- **Success rate** - Percentage of successful deliveries
- **Error logs** - Failed webhook attempts
- **Execution history** - Complete audit trail

## ðŸ”’ Security & Best Practices

### **Webhook Security**
- âœ… **HTTPS only** - All communications encrypted
- âœ… **Unique URL** - Long, random path prevents guessing
- âœ… **No authentication** exposed in logs
- âœ… **JSON validation** - Malformed requests rejected

### **Data Privacy**
- Only task-related information is sent
- User credentials never transmitted
- All data flows through secure Make.com infrastructure
- Can implement additional filtering if needed

### **Error Handling**
- If webhook fails, task info is logged locally in Supabase
- User receives confirmation that Request Mode is active
- Failed requests don't break the chat experience
- Retry logic can be implemented in Make.com

## ðŸŽ¯ Advanced Configurations

### **Conditional Processing**
Set up filters in Make.com based on:
- **Department:** Route tasks to different workflows
- **Priority:** High-priority tasks get immediate notifications  
- **Task Type:** Different actions trigger different integrations
- **User Role:** Managers vs. staff get different handling

### **Response Integration**
Configure Make.com to send status updates back:
- Task completion confirmations
- Assignment notifications
- Due date reminders
- Progress updates

### **Multi-Step Workflows**
Chain multiple Make.com modules:
1. Receive webhook data
2. Parse and validate task
3. Create task in project management tool
4. Notify assignee via Slack/email
5. Schedule follow-up reminders
6. Log completion status
