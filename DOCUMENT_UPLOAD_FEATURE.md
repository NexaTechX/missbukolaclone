# Document Upload and Conversation History Features

## Overview

This update adds two major features to the Miss Bukola AI application:

1. **Document Upload System** - Allows users to upload documents to improve the AI's knowledge base
2. **Conversation History** - Tracks and displays all conversations with the AI for analysis and improvement

## Document Upload Feature

### How it Works

Users can upload documents (currently TXT files, with PDF/DOC support planned) to enhance the AI's knowledge base. Uploaded documents are:

- Stored in the `document_store` table
- Indexed for full-text search
- Made available to the AI for context in responses
- Categorized by type, department, and access level

### Features

- **File Validation**: Supports TXT files (10MB max)
- **Metadata Capture**: Title, type, department, author, access level
- **Search Integration**: Documents are automatically indexed for AI retrieval
- **Access Control**: Public, Management, and Executive access levels
- **Audit Trail**: All uploads are logged in conversation history

### Usage

1. Click the upload icon (ðŸ“¤) in the chat header
2. Select a document file
3. Fill in the required metadata
4. Submit to add to the knowledge base

## Conversation History Feature

### How it Works

Every conversation with the AI is automatically logged to the database, including:

- User messages and AI responses
- Request mode interactions
- Task generation and webhook status
- Timestamps and user information

### Features

- **Search & Filter**: Find conversations by content or type
- **Detailed View**: See full conversation context and metadata
- **Task Tracking**: View generated tasks and webhook responses
- **Export Ready**: Data is structured for analysis

### Usage

1. Click the history icon (ðŸ“‹) in the chat header
2. Browse or search through past conversations
3. Click on any conversation to view full details
4. Filter by conversation type (All, Request Mode, Regular)

## Database Schema

### Document Store Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE document_store (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    title VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('policy', 'procedure', 'guideline', 'memo', 'report')),
    department VARCHAR(100),
    author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    date_created TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    last_updated TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    access_level VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (access_level IN ('public', 'management', 'executive')),
    search_vector TSVECTOR
);
```

### Conversation Logs Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE conversation_logs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    user_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    user_message TEXT NOT NULL,
    ai_response TEXT NOT NULL,
    request_mode_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    task_generated JSONB,
    webhook_sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    webhook_response JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## API Endpoints

### Document Upload
- **POST** `/api/documents` - Upload a new document
- **GET** `/api/documents` - Retrieve documents with filters

### Conversation History
- **GET** `/api/chat/history` - Fetch conversation history for a user

## Components

### DocumentUpload
- Modal interface for file upload
- Form validation and error handling
- Success/error feedback
- Auto-close on successful upload

### ConversationHistory
- Split-panel interface (list + detail view)
- Search and filter functionality
- Real-time data loading
- Responsive design

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Enhanced AI Knowledge**: Upload relevant documents to improve AI responses
- **Conversation Tracking**: Review past interactions and decisions
- **Task History**: Track all generated tasks and their status

### For Administrators
- **Usage Analytics**: Understand how the AI is being used
- **Content Management**: Monitor uploaded documents and their impact
- **Quality Improvement**: Identify areas for AI enhancement

### For AI Training
- **Data Collection**: Rich conversation data for model improvement
- **Document Corpus**: Growing knowledge base for better responses
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common queries and response patterns

## Future Enhancements

### Document Processing
- PDF text extraction

- Image OCR for scanned documents
- Automatic metadata extraction

### Analytics Dashboard
- Upload statistics
- Conversation analytics
- User engagement metrics
- AI performance tracking

### Advanced Features
- Document versioning
- Collaborative editing
- Approval workflows
- Integration with external systems

## Security Considerations

- File type validation
- Size limits (10MB max)
- Access level controls
- User authentication
- Audit logging

## Performance Optimizations

- Full-text search indexing
- Pagination for large datasets
- Caching for frequently accessed documents
- Efficient query patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Upload Fails**: Check file type and size
2. **History Not Loading**: Verify database connection
3. **Search Not Working**: Ensure search indexes are created

### Debug Steps

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoint responses
3. Confirm database connectivity
4. Review server logs

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set for full functionality:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

### Database Setup
Run the schema.sql file to create necessary tables and indexes.
