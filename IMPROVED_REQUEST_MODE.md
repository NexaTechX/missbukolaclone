# ðŸŽ¯ Enhanced Request Mode with Email Targeting

## âœ… **Implementation Complete!**

I've successfully implemented the improved Request Mode system that intelligently handles email targeting for task assignments. Here's what's been improved:

## ðŸ”„ **New Workflow**

### **Before (Basic Setup)**
1. User enters name, department, role
2. Request Mode sends tasks to webhook with limited targeting

### **After (Smart Email Targeting)**
1. User enters name, department, role (no email required)
2. **Smart Request Mode:**
   - For general tasks â†’ Sends immediately to webhook
   - For assignments to specific people â†’ Prompts for recipient email
   - Includes recipient email in webhook payload for precise targeting

## ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works Now**

### **Scenario 1: General Tasks (No Email Needed)**
**User Message:** *"Create a quarterly report for the marketing department"*

**Result:** âœ… Task sent immediately to webhook
```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "task": "quarterly report for the marketing department",
  "agent": "Bukola Lukan AI",
  "requested_by": "John Smith",
  "source": "request_mode"
}
```

### **Scenario 2: Specific Assignment (Email Required)**
**User Message:** *"Please assign Sarah to handle the client presentation next Friday"*

**Result:** ðŸ”” Email prompt appears

**Email Prompt:**
```
ðŸ“§ Email Required for Task Assignment
Assigning "handle the client presentation next Friday" to Sarah

[Enter Sarah's email address] [Send]
```

**After Email Provided:**
```json
{
  "action": "assign", 
  "task": "handle the client presentation next Friday",
  "assignee": "Sarah",
  "assignee_email": "sarah@gtextholdings.com",
  "due": "next Friday",
  "agent": "Bukola Lukan AI",
  "requested_by": "John Smith",
  "source": "request_mode"
}
```

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Smart Detection System**
```typescript
// AI automatically detects which tasks need email
private static taskNeedsEmail(task: TaskRequest): boolean {
  const emailRequiredActions = ['assign', 'send', 'notify', 'email', 'schedule'];
  const hasAssignee = task.assignee && task.assignee.toLowerCase() !== 'unknown';
  
  return emailRequiredActions.includes(task.action) && Boolean(hasAssignee);
}
```

### **2. Enhanced AI Response Structure**
```typescript
interface AIResponse {
  message: string;
  confidence: number;
  sources: DocumentChunk[];
  requestMode?: {
    enabled: boolean;
    taskGenerated?: TaskRequest;
    needsRecipientEmail?: {
      assignee: string;
      taskDescription: string;
      originalMessage: string;
    };
  };
}
```

### **3. Email Collection Component**
- ðŸ“± **Mobile-responsive** email input form
- âœ… **Email validation** with proper regex
- ðŸš« **Cancellation option** if user changes mind
- âš¡ **Touch-friendly** interface design

### **4. Enhanced Webhook Payload**
```typescript
interface TaskRequest {
  action: string;
  task: string;
  assignee?: string;
  assignee_email?: string;  // ðŸ†• NEW: Recipient email
  due?: string;
  priority?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'urgent';
  department?: string;
  context?: string;
  agent: 'Bukola Lukan AI';
  requested_by: string;
  source: 'request_mode';
  timestamp: string;
}
```
